I came across this great post by Theresa Neil: 30 essential controls
for RIA design. I liked control twenty-three in particular: Scoped
Search. So I cooked up a Flex 4 navigation bar (vimeo style) that has
scoped search and is completely data-driven and customizable via CSS.
It does not use any images; everything is drawn. Along the way, I
built some potentially re-usable things like a dotted line graphic
element and a vertical separator layout.
